## Real hardware instead of emulation

Playing video games via Twitch has become a thing at the latest since [TwitchPlaysPokemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/).
But while experiences like TwitchPlaysPokemon were realized with emulators on a PC, I wanted to create a gaming experience by remotely controlling a real SNES via Twitch chat commands.
